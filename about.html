  <h1>üåç About HelpFi</h1>

  <div class="container">

    <p><strong>HelpFi (HELP)</strong> is a decentralized ERC-20 token with a purpose: to bring automated, transparent donations to health-based nonprofits using blockchain technology.</p>

    <p>With each transfer, 3% of the transaction is auto-routed to <strong>CryptoRelief‚Äôs public Ethereum wallet</strong>‚Äîa well-known initiative that has supported India during the COVID-19 crisis and continues philanthropic work through <strong>Blockchain For Impact (BFI)</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>We do not collect or handle the donations ourselves.</strong> The smart contract is designed to auto-divert funds to the donation wallet address listed publicly on <a href="https://cryptorelief.in" target="_blank">CryptoRelief.in</a>.</p>

    <p>HelpFi was created with no presale, no private sale, and no investment pitch. It is a <strong>grassroots and fair-launch token</strong> built on BASE chain and supported by a group of 3 core volunteers. We‚Äôve chosen not to renounce the contract so we may update the donation wallet in future (e.g., if CryptoRelief sunsets or BFI provides a new address).</p>

    <p>Another 2% tax is used for operations and maintenance, transparently handled by the core volunteer team. Each member declares their income and abides by tax regulations individually.</p>

    <p>This project does not promise ROI, rewards, or profits. It‚Äôs a <strong>cause-first experiment</strong> in how crypto can fund social impact in a lightweight, automated way.</p>

    <p>We also operate <a href="https://cryptofundi.github.io" target="_blank">Crypto Fundi</a>, an open learning portal to help beginners understand crypto responsibly and safely.</p>

    <p>HelpFi is not affiliated with any government body, exchange, or registered NGO. It is a decentralized, experimental project run by volunteers.</p>

    <p><strong>In case the public donation wallet becomes inactive or delisted, we will notify the community and update the donation wallet transparently.</strong> Until then, we continue to use the address verified on Etherscan as <em>"India Covid-Crypto Relief Fund."</em></p>

    <p>We believe crypto can be used for good‚Äîwith transparency, caution, and collective intent.</p>
