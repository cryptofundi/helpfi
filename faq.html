  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="faq-section">
    <h2>What is HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>HelpFi is a community-driven crypto token that automatically donates 2% of every transaction to <strong>CryptoRelief</strong> to support healthcare innovation and relief efforts in India. An additional 2% goes to a marketing/admin wallet to sustain the project and grow its impact.</p>

    <h2>Is HelpFi a profit-based token?</h2>
    <p>No. HelpFi is not a profit-sharing or return-guaranteed investment. It's a social-impact token with optional upside for holders through community growth. There are no promised rewards or dividends.</p>

    <h2>Is this legal? Can I earn from promoting or working on HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>Yes, as long as all contributions and income are declared transparently. HelpFi’s admin wallet receives 2% per transaction to fund marketing and project development. If you’re contributing to the project, receiving payment from that wallet is legally permissible — but you should report it as taxable income in your country.</p>

    <h2>Is CryptoRelief officially affiliated with HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>No, CryptoRelief is not directly affiliated with HelpFi (yet). We use the public donation wallet published by them to ensure transparency. We are awaiting official permission and will immediately update the project if we receive it.</p>

    <h2>What happens when I buy HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>If you buy HelpFi for $100, you’ll receive 96% of the tokens (after the 4% tax). Out of that 4%:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>2%</strong> goes directly to CryptoRelief’s wallet.</li>
      <li><strong>2%</strong> goes to the HelpFi marketing and admin wallet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is there any utility in the future if I hold long term?</h2>
    <p>While HelpFi is primarily a social impact token, we are exploring long-term benefits such as governance participation, campaign access, NFT drops, and priority roles in future community efforts.</p>

    <h2>I bought HelpFi and made a profit. How should I view this?</h2>
    <p>That’s a win-win. A portion of your transaction supported a health relief cause, and you made a return. You can treat this as any other crypto investment — report and pay taxes accordingly — while knowing your trade helped someone in need.</p>

    <h2>Why should I buy HelpFi instead of donating directly to CryptoRelief?</h2>
    <p>You absolutely can — and should — donate directly if your only goal is charitable giving. In fact, we encourage it. But HelpFi offers something unique:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ongoing Donations:</strong> Every transaction sends 2% to CryptoRelief — not just the first one.</li>
      <li><strong>You Keep Tokens:</strong> Your $96 worth of tokens may rise in value if the community grows.</li>
      <li><strong>Web3 Awareness:</strong> You help us raise awareness for decentralized giving and support campaigns that spread impact virally.</li>
      <li><strong>Supports Education:</strong> Your contribution supports <a href="https://cryptofundi.github.io" target="_blank">Crypto Fundi</a> — free crypto education for everyone.</li>
    </ul>
