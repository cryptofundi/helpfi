  <div class="faq-section">

    <h2>What is HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>HelpFi is a community-driven crypto token that automatically donates 3% of every transaction to <strong>CryptoRelief</strong> to support healthcare innovation and relief efforts. An additional 2% goes to a marketing/operations wallet to sustain and grow the project.</p>

    <p>Yes, the HelpFi contract is open-source and verified on BaseScan. You can view and audit it yourself. We believe in full transparency for every line of code.</p>

    <h2>Is CryptoRelief officially affiliated with HelpFi?</h2>
    <p>No, CryptoRelief is not officially affiliated with HelpFi. We use their <strong>publicly available donation address</strong>. We will update all communication if official affiliation is established in the future.</p>

      <li>2% ($2) goes to HelpFi's marketing and operational wallet.</li>
      <li>You receive 95% of the tokens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Can I earn from promoting or working on HelpFi?</h2>

    <h2>Why should I buy HelpFi instead of donating directly to CryptoRelief?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous donations</strong> with every transaction</li>
        <li><strong>Community participation</strong> and optional upside</li>
        <li><strong>Education support</strong> via Crypto Fundi</li>
